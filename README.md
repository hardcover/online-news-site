# Online News Site

For news publishers, Online News Site provides a single news website for visitors from any networked device with a web browser. Online News Site adjusts the webpage format for the visitor's screen size, a responsive design to the device's viewport. Content remains unchanged across desktop computers, tablets, e-readers and mobile phones. More-detailed documentation and screen shots are available at:

For maximum portability, Online News Site runs from Linux and Windows web hosts. The required configuration is common at hosting companies, especially cPanel/CentOS hosts:

* PHP version 5.5 or newer with four extensions, gd2, mbstring, openssl and pdo_sqlite
* Web server write privileges to the includes directory, which can be located outside the public HTML folders

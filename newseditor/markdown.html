  <h1>Markdown</h1>

  <p>Markdown syntax is commonly used in web-based content management systems. By abbreviating some HTML, markdown makes it easier to read and proof the input content. For markup not covered by markdown syntax, like tables, images, iframes and videos, use regular HTML. The text below this point can be cut and pasted into an input field to see the result on the subscriber site.</p>

  <p>Headers use one to six hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels one through six. For example:</p>

  <p>#This is an H1</p>

  <p>##This is an H2</p>

  <p>###This is an H3</p>

  <p>Paragraphs, which are separated with a blank line, use two returns at the end.</p>

  <p>New lines&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  without a blank line&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  in between them&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  use two spaces&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  at the end of the line.<p>

  <p>*<i>Italic</i>* text is surrounded by single asterisks, **<b>bold</b>** text is surrounded by double asterisks.</p>

  <p>For links, the anchor text is delimited by [square brackets]. To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point.</p>

  <p>[This link](http://example.net/) is for a web page.</p>

  <p>This link, [John Doe](mailto:john.doe@example.net), is for an e-mail address.</p>

  <p>Like tables, images must be entered with regular HTML. Images are sized in the style sheet, not with specific pixel dimensions in the HTML. Specific to Online News Site, a few style classes exist for sizing images. The class "w" is for images that use the full page width. The lead classes are for smaller images with text wrapped to the right of the image. The image size gets smaller as the lead-class number increases. The smallest, lead4 images, are thumbnails. The additional image class b puts a border around the image. Here are examples beginning with full-width class w.</p>

  <p>&lt;img class="w b" src="images/logo.png" alt="" /&gt;</p>

  <p>&lt;img class="lead b" src="images/logo.png" alt="" /&gt;Lead</p>

  <p>&lt;img class="lead2 b" src="images/logo.png" alt="" /&gt;Lead2</p>

  <p>&lt;img class="lead3" src="images/logo.png" alt="" /&gt;Lead3</p>

  <p>&lt;img class="lead4" src="images/logo.png" alt="" /&gt;Lead4</p>

  <p>Markdown supports blockquotes, unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.</p>

  <p>Blockquotes use a greater-than sign followed by a space:</p>

  <p>&gt; Indented text.</p>

  <p>Unordered lists use a dash followed by a space:</p>

  <p>- Red<br />
  - Green<br />
  - Blue</p>

  <p>Ordered lists use a number followed by a period and a space:</p>

  <p>1. Bird<br />
  2. McHale<br />
  3. Parish</p>

  <p>It's important to note it's possible to trigger an ordered list by accident, by writing something like this:</p>

  <p>1986. What a great season.</p>

  <p>To avoid the result, escape the period with two preceding backslashes:</p>

  <p>1986\\. What a great season.</p>

  <p>Markdown provides backslash escapes for the characters below, which all can have an interpreted meaning within markdown depending upon where they occur. See the full <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax/" target="_blank">markdown documentation</a> for more information. When one of the characters is interpreted but is supposed to be as typed, then add two backslashes before the character.</p>

  <p>\ backslash<br />
  ` backtick<br />
  * asterisk<br />
  _ underscore<br />
  {} curly braces<br />
  [] square brackets<br />
  () parentheses<br />
  &gt; greater than<br />
  # hash mark<br />
  + plus sign<br />
  - minus sign (hyphen)<br />
  . dot<br />
  ! exclamation mark</p>

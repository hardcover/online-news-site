  <h2>Online News Site</h2>

  <p>For news publishers, Online News Site provides a single news website for visitors from any networked device with a web browser. Online News Site adjusts the webpage format for the visitor's screen size, a responsive design to the device's viewport. Content remains unchanged across desktop computers, tablets, e-readers and mobile phones. More-detailed documentation and screen shots are available at:

  <p>For maximum portability, Online News Site runs from Linux and Windows web hosts. The required configuration is common at hosting companies, especially cPanel/CentOS hosts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>PHP version 5.5 or newer with four extensions, gd2, mbstring, openssl and pdo_sqlite</li>

      <li>Web server write privileges to the includes directory, which can be located outside the public HTML folders</li>
  </ul>
